After cloning into the repository and getting into the Arrakis-dex folder, I used the ls command to list out the directories in the present working directory and then using the cd command I moved into the Eolian Caves directory as they mentioned (preferably somewhere where you have a roof over your head). Later I used the tree command to know where parchment.txt and moved into it to get the hidden code.

Using the git checkout The-Light-Realm command, I switched from the main branch to the The Light Realm branch and by using the grep tool I found the names of the files which have both 'good and happy in their content and followed the instructions to make the holy spell. The holy spell was later used to defeat Kharnok the bloodforged. Used the celestial veil amulet to unlock the chests in Dark-Realm-I and Dark-Realm-II, to get 4 codes.

These four codes are then decoded using the echo "string" | base64  --decode and other conversions to get the link to another directory --> echo aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FuZ3JlemljaGF0dGVyYm94L1RvLXRoZS1zdGFycy1hbmQtcmVhbG1zLXVuc2Vlbg== | base64 --decode

After cloning into the new repository we have to check the commit history and go through each log where we get another encoded string in the fourth commit which when decoded gives a link to another repository.
After cloning the new repository we have to run a python file which tells us that we have successfully completed all the challenges
